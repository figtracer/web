# a note on helplessness

i caught myself wishing that my fellow builders are slower and dumber than me. 

how counterproductive is this? 

wishing bad luck on others is nothing but a way to cope with my problems: 

- no job
- stalled projects
- not being confident in myself.

i value d/acc; one that gives me time to adapt, collaboratively grow and build.

bad faith slows my own momentum and betrays what i value. 

this changes now.
