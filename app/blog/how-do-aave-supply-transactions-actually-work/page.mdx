# how do aave supply transactions actually work?

example: [tenderly](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/tx/0x7b6e7761850c74b0d5c5743003e8f9dffefec6aadf720e540db1dee308ad4d72)

i got some LINK tokens on Arbitrum to play around with it and really understand how the architecture works behind all the pretty layers of abstraction.

in the analysis below, i'm going to be providing the pool with 1 LINK.

## off-chain signature: EIP-2612

the first thing AAVE prompts us, is to sign an **approval** to spend a number of tokens on our behalf. this is the raw data:

```json
{
  "types": {
    "EIP712Domain": [
      {
        "name": "name",
        "type": "string"
      },
      {
        "name": "version",
        "type": "string"
      },
      {
        "name": "chainId",
        "type": "uint256"
      },
      {
        "name": "verifyingContract",
        "type": "address"
      }
    ],
    "Permit": [
      {
        "name": "owner",
        "type": "address"
      },
      {
        "name": "spender",
        "type": "address"
      },
      {
        "name": "value",
        "type": "uint256"
      },
      {
        "name": "nonce",
        "type": "uint256"
      },
      {
        "name": "deadline",
        "type": "uint256"
      }
    ]
  },
  "primaryType": "Permit",
  "domain": {
    "name": "ChainLink Token",
    "version": "1",
    "chainId": 42161,
    "verifyingContract": "0xf97f4df75117a78c1a5a0dbb814af92458539fb4"
  },
  "message": {
    "owner": "0x974dc51e1e8ea7ce6b283d92bb47a787515a91cf",
    "spender": "0x794a61358D6845594F94dc1DB02A252b5b4814aD",
    "value": "1000000000000000000",
    "nonce": 2,
    "deadline": "1742750635"
  }
}
```

you may notice that this doesn't have the usual parameters that a "normal" transaction does (```chainId```, ```from```, ```to```). this isn't a traditional on-chain transaction, it's an **off-chain permit signature** based on [EIP-2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612).

> there's a really good article by [Vittorio Minacori](https://medium.com/noncept/understanding-eip-2612-and-erc20-permit-43ce8b829bd5) about this.

it is an [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) structured message that our wallet asks us to sign. it authorizes some address `0x794a61358d6845594f94dc1db02a252b5b4814ad`) to spend 1 LINK (`1000000000000000000 wei`) from our address (`0x974dc51e1e8ea7ce6b283d92bb47a787515a91cf`) on the LINK token contract (`0xf97f4df75117a78c1a5a0dbb814af92458539fb4`).

the purpose of this is gas optimization. instead of sending an on-chain ```approve()``` transaction (which costs gas), we use this signature to grant allowance off-chain. the signature is then submitted with the transaction and verified on-chain by the LINK token's ```permit()``` function.

after signing this, we can finally **supply** our tokens.

## the supply transaction: supplyWithPermit()

this is the raw data of the supply transaction:

```json
{
  "chainId": 42161,
  "from": " ",
  "to": "0x794a61358d6845594f94dc1db02a252b5b4814ad",
  "data": "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",
  "gas": "0x5c07b",
  "maxFeePerGas": "0xc65d40",
  "maxPriorityFeePerGas": "0xc65d40",
  "nonce": "0x3"
}
```

let's check the [function selector](https://www.4byte.directory/signatures/?bytes4_signature=0x02c205f0):

here it is! this transaction will call ```supplyWithPermit(address,uint256,address,uint16,uint256,uint8 permitV,bytes32 permitR,bytes32 permitS)``` with the LINK token address, the amount we allowed the contract to spend, my EOA address and a couple other parameters including ```uint8 permitV, bytes32 permitR, bytes32 permitS)```. these last three are the off-chain permit signature we signed before.

let's finally send the transaction and see the magic happen on Tenderly:

from this transaction alone we can already learn a lot about how AAVE works internally:

1. the contract (`0x794a61358d6845594f94dc1db02a252b5b4814ad`) we allowed to spend our tokens before is a proxy contract called ```InitializableImmutableAdminUpgradeabilityProxy```.
2. the events emitted and the contracts they were emitted from: ```InitializableImmutableAdminUpgradeabilityProxy``` and ```ClonableBeaconProxy```
   1. from ```InitializableImmutableAdminUpgradeabilityProxy```: ```ReserveDataUpdated()```, ```Transfer()```, ```Mint()```, ```ReserveUsedAsCollateralEnabled()``` and ```Supply()```
   2. from ```ClonableBeaconProxy```: ```Approval()``` (to spend the tokens), ```Transfer()``` and ```Approval()``` (revoking access to the tokens)
3. all the contracts used for this transaction
4. events emitted
5. gas

focusing only on (a portion of) the execution flow at the bottom:

```
JUMPDEST (0x974dc51e1e8ea7ce6b283d92bb47a787515a91cf => InitializableImmutableAdminUpgradeabilityProxy).supplyWithPermit0()

DELEGATECALL (InitializableImmutableAdminUpgradeabilityProxy => L2PoolInstance).supplyWithPermit()

DELEGATECALL (ClonableBeaconProxy => StandardArbERC20).permit()

/* First Approval event emitted */
LOG3 StandardArbERC20.Approval()

DELEGATECALL (InitializableImmutableAdminUpgradeabilityProxy => SupplyLogic ).executeSupply()

DELEGATECALL (InitializableImmutableAdminUpgradeabilityProxy => VariableDebtToken).scaledTotalSupply()=>()

STATICCALL (InitializableImmutableAdminUpgradeabilityProxy => DefaultReserveInterestRateStrategyV2).calculateInterestRates() =>()

/* we finally transfer 1 LINK */
DELEGATECALL (ClonableBeaconProxy => StandardArbERC20).transferFrom()=>()

/* second Approval event emitted */
LOG3 StandardArbERC20.Approval()

DELEGATECALL (InitializableImmutableAdminUpgradeabilityProxy => AToken).mint()=>()
```

AAVE follows this execution order: ```update pool data -> transfer -> mint```

the first line is a ```JUMPDEST``` at ```supplyWithPermit()```. This marks the entry point into the proxy's bytecode.

on the second line we can already see the proxy working: it performs a ```DELEGATECALL``` to the implementation contract (```L2PoolInstance```). this call executes the ```supplyWithPermit()``` logic in the context of the proxy's storage. here, the ```permit()``` call is made to the LINK token, using the signature we did before sending the transaction. this updates the allowance and emits the first ```Approval()``` event (value = 1 LINK), but doesn't transfer our tokens. Yet.

after the permit, ```supplyWithPermit()``` calls ```SupplyLogic.executeSupply()``` via another internal ```DELEGATECALL```. ```SupplyLogic``` runs in the Pool's context, using the storage references (reserves, etc.) and the ```ExecuteSupplyParams()```.

```executeSupply()``` then calls the ```scaledTotalSupply()``` of the variable debt token (`0x5e76e98e0963ecdc6a065d1435f84065b7523f39`) to calculate interest rates and reserve data. this token tracks the borrowing positions of users at variable rate mode. during this call AAVE updates the pool's state: queries the variable debt token to calculate the total debt, which feeds into ```calculateInterestRates()```, adjusting rates based on the new liquidity.

still inside ```executeSupply()```, ```safeTransferFrom()``` calls ```transferFrom()``` on the LINK token to move 1 LINK from ourselves to the aToken address. the permit allowance is consumed here, and a second ```Approval()``` event (value = 0) is emitted post-transfer to revoke it.

finally, ```executeSupply()``` mints us some aTokens. this credits us with our share of the pool.

after our tokens are supplied to the pool and aTokens are minted, AAVE is just getting started.

## conclusion

from this single transaction, we gained insight into AAVE's event emissions, gas optimization strategies, and the interplay between proxy and implementation contracts.

this practical approach proved invaluable for understanding the intricacies of decentralized lending, offering a clearer picture of how AAVE manages liquidity, interest rates, and user positions in a trustless system.

for anyone looking to grasp the inner workings of DeFi protocols, combining theoretical study with on-chain experimentation is a powerful way to bridge the gap between concept and reality.
