# how does the constant keyword actually work?

it all started when i was going through Cyfrin's Solidity Smart Contract Development course (https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/solidity) and came across the ```constant``` keyword. I knew it was supposed to save gas, but I wanted to see exactly _how_, not just in theory, but at the bytecode level.

so, i decided to dig deeper... and this article was born.

i'll break down what happens behind the scenes when you use ```constant```, how it affects storage, gas costs, and why it matters for smart contract optimization.

here's our smart contract example(s):

**NoConstant.sol**

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

contract ConstantImmutable {
	uint256 public favoriteNumber = 5;
}
```

**Constant.sol**

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

contract ConstantImmutable {
	uint256 public constant favoriteNumber = 5;
}
```

```NoConstant.sol``` declares a public variable **favoriteNumber** initialized to 5. When compiled, this variable is stored in the contract's storage, and a getter function is automatically generated because it's _public_.

the modified contract ```Constant.sol``` adds the _constant_ keyword. with _constant_, **favoriteNumber** becomes a compile-time constant embedded in the bytecode rather than a storage variable. this eliminates the need for storage access and changes how the getter function behaves.

if we compile ```NoConstant.sol``` with ```solc -o NoConstantDir --bin NoConstant.sol``` we get this stream of bytes:

```
608060405260055f553480156012575f5ffd5b5060ac80601e5f395ff3fe6080604052348015600e575f5ffd5b50600436106026575f3560e01c8063471f7cdf14602a575b5f5ffd5b60306044565b604051603b9190605f565b60405180910390f35b5f5481565b5f819050919050565b6059816049565b82525050565b5f60208201905060705f8301846052565b9291505056fea26469706673582212204db89e73bbbb0573dc471b03586b22e69fc03409f4604fce921014f4d28aa1e464736f6c634300081c0033
```

let's do the same thing for ```Constant.sol``` with ```solc -o ConstantDir --bin Constant.sol```:

```
6080604052348015600e575f5ffd5b5060ac80601a5f395ff3fe6080604052348015600e575f5ffd5b50600436106026575f3560e01c8063471f7cdf14602a575b5f5ffd5b60306044565b604051603b9190605f565b60405180910390f35b600581565b5f819050919050565b6059816049565b82525050565b5f60208201905060705f8301846052565b9291505056fea26469706673582212205023b6e0afc1b00eed2d55f7dae23db61ec3d95bbc6be68efa7def3c7bcc85d464736f6c634300081c0033
```

> the flag `-o` creates a directory with the contents inside.

right away we can see that the bytecode result (with _constant_) is smaller than the previous stream of bytes that we got from compiling ```NoConstant.sol```.

## background: what's happening in the contracts?
for example, in ```NoConstant.sol```, the constructor ends at 0x001c with **RETURN**, and the runtime code begins at 0x001e.

```
(...)
0x0014:	PUSH1	0xAC
0x0016:	DUP1
0x0017:	PUSH1	0x1E
0x0019:	PUSH0
0x001a:	CODECOPY
0x001b:	PUSH0
0x001c:	RETURN		<------- End of the constructor
0x001d:	INVALID
0x001e:	PUSH1	0x80	<------- Runtime Start
0x0020:	PUSH1	0x40
0x0022:	MSTORE
0x0023:	CALLVALUE
```

> the INVALID opcode at 0x001d is a **separator** between the constructor code and the runtime code in the compiled bytecode. it ensures that if execution somehow continues past the RETURN during deployment, it crashes immediately. this prevents the EVM from accidentally running into the runtime code as part of the constructor.

## constructor: storage initialization vs none

now that we know what the constructors are and where they are, we can already see a couple of differences right at the start:

- in **NoConstant.sol**: the constructor explicitly stores the value 5 in storage slot 0 (**PUSH1** 0x05). this makes **favoriteNumber** a persistent state variable that can be read later via the getter.
- in **Constant.sol**: this section is absent. the constructor no longer includes **SSTORE** or any storage initialization for **favoriteNumber**. since it's a constant, the value 5 is written into the bytecode at compile time (shown in the section below) and doesn't need to be written to storage during deployment. this reduces both bytecode size and deployment gas costs.

## getter function: storage read vs. hardcoded return

> we're not going to use Soler here, since it would be too crowded with images. i can make a video showcasing this in the future.

i said before that the _public_ keyword generates a getter function.

let's compare how it retrieves **favoriteNumber**:

- **NoConstant.sol**:

```
    0x0048: JUMPDEST		   // start of getter function
    0x0049: PUSH1 0x30
    0x004b: PUSH1 0x44
    0x004d: JUMP			   // jump to return logic
    ...
    0x0062: JUMPDEST		   // return value logic
    0x0063: PUSH0         	   // slot 0
    0x0064: SLOAD         	   // load value from storage slot 0
    0x0065: DUP2
    0x0066: JUMP          	   // return to caller
```

here, the getter jumps to a block that uses **SLOAD** to read **favoriteNumber** from storage slot 0. this requires an on-chain storage access (costing 2100 gas in EVM terms) every time the function is called.

- **Constant.sol**:

```
   0x0044: JUMPDEST      // start of getter function
   0x0045: PUSH1 0x30
   0x0047: PUSH1 0x44
   0x0049: JUMP          // jump to return logic
   ...
   0x005e: JUMPDEST      // return value logic
   0x005f: PUSH1 0x05    // push the constant value 5
   0x0061: DUP2
   0x0062: JUMP          // return to caller
```

here, instead of **SLOAD**, the getter simply pushes the hardcoded value 5 onto the stack with **PUSH1** 0x05 (costing 3 gas). no storage access is needed because **favoriteNumber** is embedded in the code itself.

## why these differences matter

- **gas efficiency**:
  - deployment: ```NoConstant.sol``` uses more gas due to **SSTORE** (20,000 gas for the first write to a slot).
  - execution: the getter in ```Constant.sol``` saves ~2097 gas per call by avoiding **SLOAD**.
- **security**: constants can't be modified, reducing attack surfaces (e.g., no risk of accidental overwrites in storage).
- **code size**: smaller bytecode in ```Constant.sol``` means lower deployment costs and a leaner contract.

## conclusion

adding _constant_ transforms **favoriteNumber** from a dynamic storage variable into a static, hardcoded value. this eliminates storage operations in both the constructor and getter, shrinking the bytecode and slashing gas costs.

## how did we get the getter function's location?

when you mark a variable public (like ```uint256 public favoriteNumber```), the compiler auto-generates a getter function. this function has a unique identifier called a _function selector_ (4-byte hash derived from the function's signature). for ```favoriteNumber()```, the signature is favoriteNumber(), and its selector is ```0x471f7cdf```, calculated as the first 4 bytes of ```keccak256("favoriteNumber()")```.

the runtime bytecode includes a _dispatcher_ (a switch-like mechanism to route incoming calls to the right function based on this selector). here's how it works (using NoConstant.sol's disassembled opcodes):

```
0x002e: PUSH1 0x04
0x0030: CALLDATASIZE
0x0031: LT
0x0032: PUSH1 0x26
0x0034: JUMPI
0x0035: PUSH0
0x0036: CALLDATALOAD        // load first 32 bytes of calldata
0x0037: PUSH1 0xE0
0x0039: SHR             	// shift right to get first 4 bytes (selector)
0x003a: DUP1
0x003b: PUSH4 0x471F7CDF  	// getter selector
0x0040: EQ             		// does it match?
0x0041: PUSH1 0x2A
0x0043: JUMPI          		// if yes, jump to 0x2a in the runtime code (0x001e + 0x2a = 0x0048)
0x0044: JUMPDEST      		// fallback
0x0045: PUSH0
0x0046: PUSH0
0x0047: REVERT        		// no match, revert
0x0048: JUMPDEST       		// getter starts here
```

when a call comes in, the _dispatcher_ checks the first 4 bytes of the calldata against ```0x471f7cdf```. if it matches, it jumps to the getter's starting point at 0x0048. this selector-based routing is how Solidity handles all public functions.
