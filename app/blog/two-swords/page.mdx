# two swords

yesterday, right when i was leaving the apartment to go to work at the office, an old sweet-natured woman who i hadn't seen since i was about 10 crossed paths with me.

from my perspective, those 5 minutes that i was talking with Her were incredibly reassuring. i felt so close to Her at that moment. everything She was saying resonated with me.

while for Her, i probably seemed uninterested in Her dialogue. She was devastated to have such a repetitive life after losing Her husband and now living alone. Her grandkids don't seem to care much, judging by the way She expressed things to me.

from my perspective, the last 10 years pierced through me before i had time to react. these last 10 years hurt me and kicked me in the face multiple times, and the next 10 will most likely do the same.

while for Her, these last 5 years slowly crept in like my 20 years of life. digesting Her, corrupting Her, and Her love.

a decade is half of my life.

half of that crushed me in the blink of an eye since covid-19 hit us.

time is really just a human construction, a life-long self-destructing concept that we inherited from having a conscious brain.

it changes so abruptly in the eyes of someone who's too lost in their own mind and then nothing remains.
